						<p>Throughout my early student life I was able to coast with little to no effort with straight A's/B's. It didn't hit me until senior year of HS that I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. So I took the typical (safe) route and went to the University of Toledo as a business student. Once again, I coasted through college and graduated with a double major in Marketing and Management. Post graduation I worked as an account manager for a manufacturing company where my duties involved sales, purchasing and some marketing. After 2 years of doing this I realized that I had zero interest in this field and felt empty as I never felt 'accomplished' at the end of the day. This is where I did some soul searching and found the coding boot camp at Case which is just the challenge I needed in life that'll carry me on to a successful career path.</p>
